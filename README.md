## 🔒 Data Validation

The application includes comprehensive validation to ensure data integrity:

### Back-end Validation (Rails Model)
- **Title**: 
  - Required, must be unique (case-insensitive)
  - Length: 2-200 characters
  - Shows friendly error if duplicate

- **Rating**: 
  - Required
  - Must be an integer (no decimals)
  - Range: 0-5 stars only
  - Clear error message: "must be an integer between 0 and 5"

- **Description**: 
  - Required
  - Length: 10-1000 characters
  - Shows error if too short or too long

- **Release Date**: 
  - Required
  - Cannot be in the future
  - Cannot be before 1800
  - Validates reasonable date range

### Front-end Validation (HTML5 & JavaScript)
- **required attributes** - Prevents form submission with empty fields
- **minlength/maxlength** - Browser enforces character limits
- **date input with max** - Prevents selecting future dates
- **Character counter** - Real-time feedback (10-1000 characters)
- **Visual indicators** - Color changes based on character count:
  - 🔴 Red: Too few characters (< 10)
  - 🟢 Green: Valid character count (10-900)
  - 🟡 Yellow: Approaching limit (900-1000)

### Error Handling
- Clear, descriptive error messages
- Error messages displayed in red box on form
- Full validation messages explain what's wrong
- Prevents invalid data from being saved
